# Huffman Coding Implementation

This repository contains a C-based implementation of Huffman Coding for file compression and decompression. The project is structured around building, encoding, and decoding Huffman Trees, a lossless data compression technique.

## Features
- Count character frequencies in a given file.
- Build a Huffman Tree based on character frequencies.
- Generate prefix codes for each character.
- Compress a text file into a binary format using the generated codes.
- Decompress the binary file back into the original text.

## Files
- **tree.h**: Header file defining the binary tree structure and related functions.
- **tree.c**: Implementation of binary tree operations.
- **Huffman.c**: Main file containing the Huffman coding logic, including compression and decompression.
